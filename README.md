# NHLRefHometowns
A map of where NHL referees and linesmen were born/grew up. Sourced from the [NHL Officials Association](https://nhlofficials.com/nhl-officials/current/). I'm not sure how up to date this data is, but it's the best source I could find.

Some officials had home towns referenced in their biographies that were different than their place of birth. I defaulted to doing home towns where available, since I think that is more relevant information than where someone was born.

#Instructions
First install all dependencies by doing `npm install`. Then, simply do `npm start`, which should open your web browser.

This code was heavily templated from an assignment from Professor Alex Wellerstein, so most credit goes to him.
